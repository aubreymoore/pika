<h4>Natural history of pepper</h4>

<aside class="notes">
Like many other plants, peppers use animals to solve transportation problems including seed dispersal. Pepper fruits "want to be eaten by animals" so that seeds will be widely dispersed. They even advertise their availability by turning red when ripe.

Birds are great seed dispersers for pepper seeds because seeds are swallowed whole. However, mammals are poor seed dispersers because most of the small pepper seeds are crushed to death by molar teeth.

Through evolution pepper plants solved this problem by putting capsaicin in their fruits. Capsaicin is a powerful repellant for mammals. But birds do not have neural receptors to detect this chemical.
