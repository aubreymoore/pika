<h4>Natural history of chili pepper</h4>
<img class="r-stretch" src="images/Capsicum-annuum.jpg">
<aside class="notes">
<p>Like many other plants, peppers use animals to solve transportation problems including seed dispersal. Pepper fruits "want to be eaten by animals" so that seeds will be widely dispersed. They even advertise their availability by turning red when ripe.</p>
<p>Birds are great dispersers for pepper seeds because they are swallowed whole. However, when mammals eat peppers, most of the seeds are crushed to death by molar teeth.</p>
<p>Through evolution pepper plants solved this problem by putting capsaicin in their fruits. Capsaicin is a powerful repellant for mammals. But birds do not have neural receptors to detect this chemical.</p>

<h4>Human interactions with chili pepper</h4>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Chili pepper plants belong to the genus <i>Capsicum</i> which is native to the Americas.
The first indiginous people harvested wild fruit and started cultivation about 8,000 years ago.</p>
<p>This map shows the range of for <i>Capsicum</i> when Columbus arrived in 1492.</p>
<p>Columbus returned to Europe with <i>Capsicum</i> seeds. The original varieties were far too hot for the European pallete, but plant breeding successfully resulted in reducing capsaicin content. An extreme example is the bell pepper variety which contains very little capsaicin.</p>
<p>It is beleived that <i>Capsicum</i> was spread to Asia by Portuguese and Spanish traders following Magellan's circumnavigation of the earth in 1519-1522.</p>
<p>Chili pepper quickly became an essential ingredient in the cuisine of many countries including Italy, Thailand, and China.</p>
